            <p class="featured-description">Hydroponic farming allows us to grow shallots and other crops in a
              sustainable
              way. These plants are able
              to absorb minerals from the water they're grown in, so they can be given an even healthier diet.
              Hydroponic
              farming means better quality, more consistent production, and faster growth—allowing you to reap the
              benefits of new Labda agriculture products sooner.</p>
